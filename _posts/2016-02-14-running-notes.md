### What all needs fixing? 

  * The font is just right. At least the single hash definitely is. Actually it is growing on me. I am liking it. Just the single has was too grotesque.  
  * We still need some sort of automated way to push changes. And something that is not too heavy. 
  * I actually like the way it shows up on iPhone. It is nice and minimalistic.
  * Get rid of the link to Pixyll. And About Pixyll. And do something to the Say Hello.
