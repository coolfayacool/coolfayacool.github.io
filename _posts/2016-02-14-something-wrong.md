# How to setup git command line to connect with github account? 

```
git config --global user.name "coolfayacool"
git config --global user.email "coolfayacool@gmail.com"
```

Welcome me to github.io. blog. Let's blog like a hacker man. :) 

### What all needs fixing? 

  * The font is too big for my taste. At least the single hash definitely is. 
  * We still need some sort of automated way to push changes. And something that is not too heavy. 
  * I actually like the way it shows up on iPhone. It is nice and minimalistic. 

### A pedantic way to push changes to git. 
```
git add --all && git commit -m "new version" && git push 
```
It is a bit pedestrian but, it is guaranteed not to eat too much system resource. And it will not run without me knowing. 

There was the other one. But, one, I could not get it to work. Second, I could not get it to work. Third, it is a little too clever script for me. I could not make head or tail out of it. Or how is it supposed to work.
